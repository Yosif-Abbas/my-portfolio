description: 'EduQuest is a role-based learning platform with distinct teacher and student experiences. Teachers can create and manage courses, while students enroll, browse content, and track their learning progress.\nI built a responsive React interface with real-time data fetching, authentication, and structured state management to ensure smooth interactions and reliable data flow across roles.'
